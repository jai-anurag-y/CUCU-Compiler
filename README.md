# CUCU-Compiler

## Steps to Run the Compiler
1. `lex cucu.l`
2. `yacc -d cucu.y`
3. `gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o cucu`
4. `./cucu sample1.cu`

## Files

### cucu.l
- Tokens are generated using `lex`.
- Regular expressions are written for each token.
- All operators, literals, and reserved keywords are separated.
- These tokens are then sent to the `yacc` file for grammar checking.
- All tokens are printed in `Lexer.txt`.

### cucu.y
- The tokens generated by `lex` are checked to see if they follow correct grammar.
- Grammar rules are written in BNF format.
- The flow of control is printed in `Parser.txt`.

## Sample Files
- `sample1.cu` has correct syntax.
- `sample2.cu` has incorrect syntax.

Thank you!
